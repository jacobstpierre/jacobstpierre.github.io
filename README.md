## [Project 1 - Bicycle Thefts in Toronto](https://github.com/jacobstpierre/Bicycle-Theft-in-Toronto)
![](/Users/jakestpierre/Desktop/CSDA 1000/bike-thief-cartoon.jpeg)
Capstone Project for York University Into to Big Data Analytics

This was the first project I completed for the aforementioned course. Working in a team with two other classmates, I took up the task of doing all programming work. I was able to apply my Python knowledge the previous two months I had spent studying and practising Python.

The purpose of this project was to test our abilities not only in programming, but also in project understanding and the CRISP-Decision Model application. In order to complete this project extensive data cleaning was required, as victims were the ones entering thier information, which was often prone to errors. In doing this analysis, I was able to derive insight into which type of bicycle gets stolen, when these thefts are most likely to occur, and the location of these thefts. After doing this anylsis I looked at whether changes in police spending in the division is correlated to a reduction in thefts. While in the reality, bicycle theft is primarily motivated by opportunity, this analysis confirmed that.

## [Project 2 - Titanic Prediction Model](https://github.com/jacobstpierre/Titanic-Prediction-Model/blob/main/Kaggle%20Titanic%20ML.ipynb)
First run through of the Kaggle Titanic Competition. The goal here is simple, use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Part of what had initially interested me in this competition, apart from practicing machine leanring techniques and skills, was the opportunity for an indepth exploratory data analysis.
